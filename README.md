# PREDICTING-STUDENT-GRADUATION-DROPOUT
This is a repository of a project made by David Goldstein, Yonatan Navon, and Ariel Friedlander from Bar-Ilan University in the Statistical Theory course in 2024

The repository contains the dataset, the article we wrote about our work and findings, and the code we used.
Also here is a link to the Google Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1gklfqrK5CnG4pzAknI8ffyMkpuAQDNUg?usp=sharing

# Instruction for running the code on your computer

***Downloading and where do put the dataset***
1. Download the dataset
2. Put the data set in your Google Drive wherever you want

***Opening and running the code***
1. Download the ipynb file called **Statistical_theory_project**
2. Open it using any Python running environment
3. Copy the path of the dataset from your drive
4. In the **General** area, paste the path of the dataset in the code line  ---- df = pd.read_csv("put your path here") ---- where it is said to put your path
5. Run the code and enjoy the many operations that are being done on the data set :) 





# STUDENT-DROPOUT-GRADUATION-PREDICTOR

This project was made by David Goldstein, Yonatan Navon, and Ariel Friedlander from Bar_Ilan University in the
Statistical Theory course in 2024

The repository contains the dataset, the article we wrote about our work and findings, and the code we used. You can use
the link to the [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1gklfqrK5CnG4pzAknI8ffyMkpuAQDNUg?usp=sharing

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, VS Code)
- Required libraries: pandas, numpy, and other necessary libraries mentioned in the project code.

## Getting Started

### 1. Download the Dataset

1. Download the dataset and save it locally on your system or upload it to your preferred cloud storage service (e.g.,
   Google Drive).

### 2. Set Up the Project

1. Download the project file named Statistical_theory_project.ipynb.
2. Open the .ipynb file using your preferred Python environment such as Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

### 3. Configure the Dataset Path

   1. Copy the file path of the dataset you just downloaded.

   2. In the code section labeled General, locate the line:

      
      df = pd.read_csv("put your path here")
      

   3. Replace the placeholder put your path here with the actual path of your dataset file. The line should look like
   this:

      
      df = pd.read_csv("path/to/your/dataset.csv")
      

### 4. Run the Code

* Once the path is set correctly, run the entire notebook.
* The code will perform a series of operations on the dataset, showcasing various statistical techniques and results.

### 5. Explore the Results
   * The project includes data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis.
   * You can explore the outputs and graphs generated for deeper insights into the data.
   
## Troubleshooting
   * Ensure the dataset path is correctly set. If using a cloud storage service like Google Drive, make sure the file
   permissions are correctly configured.
   * Verify that all required libraries are installed.
