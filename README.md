# PREDICTING-STUDENT-GRADUATION-DROPOUT
This is a repository of a project made by David Goldstein, Yonatan Navon, and Ariel Friedlander from Bar-Ilan University in the Statistical Theory course in 2024

The repository contains the dataset, the article we wrote about our work and findings, and the code we used.
Also here is a link to the Google Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1gklfqrK5CnG4pzAknI8ffyMkpuAQDNUg?usp=sharing
